Low complexity residual convolutional neural network for channel estimation

Conpared with the ReEsNet from the repo Residual_CNN, it has slightly improved performance and the number of parameters is reduced by 82% (when pruning is not applied). I planed to release the code when I sorted out the files. 

One thing you need to keep in mind is that, the pruning is applied without retraining because it aims to minimize the computations/latency for low-complexity solutions. Typically, after pruning there should be complex procedures (Learning both weights and connections for efficient neural networks, arXivpreprint) to compensate, but that is not realistic for low-latency and low-complexity online implementation. For sure, that pruning degrades the performance significantly. Therefore, I just remove the retraining and feedback loop.
