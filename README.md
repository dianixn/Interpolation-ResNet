# Interpolation-ResNet
Invited paper for WSA 2021

The paper is 'Low Complexity Channel estimation with Neural Network Solutions'.

Low complexity residual convolutional neural network for channel estimation

Conpared with the ReEsNet from the repo Residual_CNN, it has slightly improved performance and the number of parameters is reduced by 82% (pruningis not applied)

Yes, I use the neural network for both time interpolation and frequency interpolation, and for denoising.

Our society is really a master on the trash researchs. Almost all the papers are purely for research purpose, because using the complete channel matrix, even the channel matrix on the data symbols, for training. We use a data-driven method and process the channel matrix of the data symbols in? Everyone know that is trash and impractical compeletely, but no one stands up and says you have no cloths on. How we can achieve online training? We are celebrating the unprecedented success we got by training with the complete channel matrix, should I ask if we have already know the channel matrix of complete package, why we estimate it? solar flashlight? If we have already known the channel matrix at the data symbols then we can estimate it, if not then we cannot? It reminds me of the bitcoin, no one really cares if they did is correct, as long as can make money. We neither, as long as can publish paper on top journal/conference. I can understand some people maight submit papers but get rejection because they said "oh why u dont use channel matrix of complete package and it seems like the proposed neural network is overkills for that problem, you need to do something like us". What I want to is that,

For the people, who with name, and without. For the real engineers.
