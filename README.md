Low complexity residual convolutional neural network for channel estimation

Conpared with the ReEsNet from the repo Residual_CNN, it has slightly improved performance and the number of parameters is reduced by 82% (pruningis not applied). I use the neural network for both time interpolation and frequency interpolation, and for denoising.
